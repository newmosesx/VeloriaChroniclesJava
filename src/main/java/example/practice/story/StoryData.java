                        "That night in the tavern, the mood was lighter. Bram drank deeply, Lyra tended to the children who were now sleeping soundly by the hearth, and Iriah was buying a round of ale she couldn't have afforded that morning. She laughed, a sharp, bright sound in the dim room.",
                        "Kaelen watched her from his corner, turning the cursed shard over in his palm. He had seen her smile that way before—the same sweet poison she gave a mark just before lifting his purse. He hadn't seen the farmer's second payment disappear, but he didn't need to. The answer was in the cheap ale she was now pouring so freely.",
                        "He didn't move to confront her. An accusation was pointless and would only fracture their fragile alliance. Instead, he filed the information away. She was not just a rogue; she was a liability. Her greed made her predictable, but it also made her reckless.",
                        "He closed his fist around the shard, the metal biting into his flesh. The warmth was almost comforting. The shard didn't pretend to be anything other than what it was: a thing of hunger and power. In that, it was more honest than the woman laughing across the room.",
                        "This wasn't a mission. It was a matter of managing threats. And Kaelen was beginning to realize that the most immediate ones weren't the monsters in the woods, but the people walking beside him."

The rebels had chosen it for that very ruin: easy to hide in, and harder for a patrol to spot than a purposeful camp. Lanterns burned low, the light indifferent to the shapes huddled within. Folks came and went like shadows—smiths, a handful of men who’d held soldiers’ spears once, women who learned how to make a weapon from a scythe.",
                        "Mara Voss sat on a splintered beam, mapping routes in dust. Her hands were thin and callused; she had the look of someone who had once put papers to the law and found the law’s mouth full of blood. When she spoke, everyone listened.",
                        "“You take a market one day, hold it two,” she told them. “You let the folks trade, you keep the mills running. You don’t become the tyrant. We hold what helps people live, not what lets us lord over them.”",
                        "She introduced Joric Fen then—a man whose uniform had been cut into tatters but whose stride still had a captain’s rhythm. Joric had been a garrison captain once, which made him useful. He spoke in quiet, measured tones, always a calculation in his jaw.",
                        "“Tomorrow we strike the north road,” he said. “The convoy that takes tents and grain to Aldren’s garrison. We slow that and the garrison starves sooner. We free three prisoners at an outpost on its flank. We watch for the Grey Company. If they show, we pull.”",
                        "They left when the moon was lean, moving like a shadow with a purpose. Joric took point with three men close behind him, his face set like flint. They waited until the convoy slowed by the ford, lanterns bobbing like will-o’-the-wisps.",

                        "He moved and so did the men behind him. They smashed the wagon’s near wheel with a timber swing, splinters crying out. The first soldier swore loud enough to startle the horses. Then blades were out: short, hard, practiced. Joric’s hand followed the cadences of dozens of skirmishes, leaving no room for the romantic. There was only space for survival.",
                        "A captain turned, eyes wide at the black shapes surrounding him. He was braver than his men, carrying himself like someone who had eaten courage for breakfast. He raised a sword. Joric raised his faster.",
                        "He met the captain’s blade, the shock running up his arm like a live thing. He favored the weak side of the man’s guard and struck low. The captain bled out into the dust. The two men Joric had chosen to flank him took the cart driver by surprise. They had designed this to be quick; surprise makes the slow swift.",
                        "They took the convoy in under fifteen breaths, killing no more than they had to. That was another rule: keep the countryside angry at their masters, not at them. They took the grain, the tents, and the sealed chest with the officers’ pay. They unshackled the prisoners.",
                        "At the far edge of the camp, one of his men came to him coughing, blood around his lips. “Map,” the man said, handing Joric the manifest. The ink was blurred by rain. The name of a place he’d never heard before—Brethford—and a list of outposts scheduled to receive the shards.",
                        "The word landed in him like cold iron.",
                        "There’s a moment in every fight: when the rush stops and the body count has weight. They counted what they lost. They counted what they carried. The manifest was new weight. They ghosted back under the moonlight.",
                        "By dawn, the wagons were hidden. The freed prisoners staggered and ate. One of them, a lanky boy with a fever, clutched the hem of Mara’s coat. “This is only one road,” he said. “Aldren has twenty more.”",
                        "Mara’s face showed no despair, only the calculus of a woman who found the world lacking mercy. “Then we get twenty more roads,” she said. “We build a map the King can’t read.”",
